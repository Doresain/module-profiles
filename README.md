A module for FoundryVTT that allows for swapping between multiple customizable module profiles.

## TODO
- Implement Typescript
- Import/export
- Error messages
- Bug where newly-added modules aren't marked as orange, but the profile is. 
  - Similar to the export list being the whole list of any profile that's ever existed in the game world. Trim that down
