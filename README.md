A module for FoundryVTT that allows for swapping between multiple customizable module profiles.

## TODO
- Implement Typescript
- Import/export
- Localization
- The export list being the whole list of any profile that's ever existed in the game world. Trim that down
  - Similarly, make sure that when a new module is added to the world, make sure that either a) gets added to the list of modules on the profile, or b) represent that on the frontend somehow
  - Similarly, make sure that modules are stored in alphabetical order
