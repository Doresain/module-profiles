## Why should you use this?

Have you ever wanted to test out a new module, but you don't want to lose your current module configuration? Perhaps, you as a GM want a different group of 
modules for prepping vs. game-time? Or maybe you're a module developer, and you want to easily swap between your module in a sandbox and your module combined 
with dozens of others, to test conflicts?

Well, look no further!

Module Profiles is an enhancement to the module management configuration window in Foundry. It allows you - the GM - to swap between different
combinations of modules - AKA, "module profiles" - to allow for different profiles for different scenarios. Simply click on the "Manage Module Profiles"
button in the module management configuration window to get started.

## What's it do?

Adds the ability to swap between different module profiles
