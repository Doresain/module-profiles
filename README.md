A module for FoundryVTT that allows for swapping between multiple customizable module profiles.

## TODO
- Import/export
- Localization
- Make sure that when a new module is added to the world, make sure that either a) gets added to the list of modules on the profile, or b) represent that it doesn't exist for that profile. Show it on the frontend somehow
